# Hogwarts Legacy Spellcaster

**Hogwarts Legacy Spellcaster** is a speech recognition tool designed to enhance your gameplay experience in Hogwarts Legacy. By recognizing your voice commands, it automatically casts spells in the game, making your wizarding journey even more immersive.

## How It Works

1. **Launch the Executable:**
   - Run the provided `Whisper-Spell.exe` file to start the program.

2. **Choose Your Microphone Device:**
   - Select the microphone you want to use for voice recognition.

3. **Configure Your Keybindings:**
   - Open the `keybinding.txt` file.
